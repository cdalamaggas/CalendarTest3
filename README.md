Hi Chris,

Thank you for providing the solution. I have checked it and indeed the issue is reproduced there.  The only difference from my test app is that this solution uses Xamarin.Forms Shell, so that's why I didn't manage to replicate it initially.

I would need some more time to investigate the exact reason behind this, I will send you an update early next week.

On a side note, our support system permits attachments with up to 20 MB size, which basically is enough for sample apps.  I've also downloaded the example from github as a zip and its size is about 600KB. It's strange that you received such an error, when you tried to upload it in the thread. If it happens again, please let me know, so we could additionally test this.

Regards,
Yana
